## Career Development
A well established Game Developer working in Game Industry for several years as a Graphic Programmer. I have a good all around understanding about AAA Game Development on both PC and Consoles.
I never thought myself as one of the smartest elites but I like to think that I'm a natural learner where I'm ready to accelerate myself over the limits into learning new things. I'm very much self driven, and can be completely autonomous in Research and Development. I'm always enjoyed exploring new technologies in order to make the best out of modern hardwares and low-level APIs.

Not only the technical side, I'm also very keen on People and Project Management. A track record that I have a good personality for leadership. I'm a team player with skills that could help connecting people together. I have a strong idea about Productivity and Communication. For this, I'm very positive that I could help leading and supporting the team, and make any projects into a success story.

I always want to learn and explore, in order to understand more about the full spectrum of modern software industry, and my interest has become broader over time. I'm always curious about my potential to contribute into other fields of software development outside Game Industry as well. There are so many interesting projects these days evolving around Machine Learning and Big Data, which I'd love to get involved. Some of them I'm really excited about, for example, an Autonomous Vehicles, Visualization Software in Medical, Fitness application and etc.

## Personal Development
Like every other coders, I do have fun learning outside work and I have many personal projects at home. I like spending my spare time learning new programming languages and APIs that I might not use fluently at work and try to use them for making small games and software of my own interests. I like playing around with ML, Data Analysis, Web technologies and sometimes getting involve in Weekend Game Jam for experimenting different frameworks and Game Engines.

It is very important to keep a good balance between mind and body. I'm a fluent Yoga practitioner, this is where I learn to be mindful and develop my self-awareness. I like doing long distance hiking as a form of meditation. Going outdoors is also a good way to improve my diet and keeping fit. I regularly join Dancing and Pilates classes, as I'm always fascinated in improving Body Coordination. I also enjoy playing various kinds of team sports with my friends. It is such a great fun socializing with each others this way.

Relaxation is an important key as well, I like reading books, practice meditation and listening to soft music at home. My favorite topic is usually around Productivity, Philosophy and Human Psychology. Applying many techniques I learned from these books to help managing my time so I can use my daily amount of focus a little more efficiently.
