## Project Psychology: Using Psychological Models and Techniques to Create a Successful Project
<small>updated 23/03/2017</small>

I want to recommend this book, not only for Project manager, but also other team members as well. It is very easy to read, very practical and it helps you understand your management team better. I really enjoyed learning about different type of leadership, and techniques for connecting people together. I learned how important it is to be emotional intelligent, and how to improve it.

## Buddha's Brain: The Practical Neuroscience of Happiness, Love, and Wisdom
<small>updated 23/03/2017</small>

This book simply has changed my life. It is the first book I read where it took Buddhism and explained it in such scientific way. You will learn about your brain, what makes you sad, what makes you happy, how to might be able to let it go, and how to keep it. This is very beautiful because it is talking about a deep religious concept, but not at all, religious.
