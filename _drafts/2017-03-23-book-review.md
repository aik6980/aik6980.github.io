fills your head with new bits of information, and you never know when it might come in handy. Reading regularly will help improving your focus and concentration, not only that,
it also help practicing your analytic thinking skills. There's a reading genre for every literate person on the planet, whether your tastes lie in classical literature, magazines, young adults book, self-help guides. Let's me help get you started.

## Buddha's Brain: The Practical Neuroscience of Happiness, Love, and Wisdom
<small>updated 23/03/17</small>

This book simply has changed my life. It is the first book I read where it took Buddhism and explained it in such scientific way. You will learn about your brain, what makes you sad, what makes you happy, how to might be able to let it go, and how to keep it. This is very beautiful because it is talking about a deep religious concept, but not at all, religious.

## My year of meats, Ruth Ozeki
<small>updated 30/06/17</small>

I like watching a good Sitcom, and this book is exactly like that. I really like the setting, and how the writer told the story. It is very funny and often give me chuckle every few pages.

## Norwegian woods, Haruki Murakami
<small>updated 30/06/17</small>

A classic, my second read from Murakami and I'm not disappointed. I think I like this one more than Colourless, thinking about it, I want to give that to a benefit of the doubt and I might have revisit that book again sometimes. I really like Murakami works, but I think you have to be in the right mood before you settle in.

Norwegian woods told the story of a man, his slice of life. 

## Project Psychology: Using Psychological Models and Techniques to Create a Successful Project
<small>updated 23/03/17</small>

I want to recommend this book, not only for Project manager, but also other team members as well. It is very easy to read, very practical and it helps you understand your management team better. I really enjoyed learning about different type of leadership, and techniques for connecting people together. I learned how important it is to be emotional intelligent, and how to improve it.
