## Career aspect
I want to learn and explore, in order to understand more about the full spectrum of modern software development. Here, my interest doesn't stop only at Video Games but also apply towards Movies and Other Interactive media software industry as well.

I'm a well established Game Developer working in Game Industry for several years as a Graphic Programmer. I have a good all around knowledge about AAA Game Development in both Consoles and PC, DirectX and OpenGL.
I never thought myself as one of the smartest elites but I like to think that I'm a natural learner where I'm ready to accelerate myself over the limits into learning new things. I always enjoy doing R&D, exploring new techniques in order to make the best out of modern hardwares and low-level APIs.

Apart from the technical side of knowledge, I'm also very much interested in People and Project Management. I strongly believed that I have a good personality. I'm a team player with great skills that help connecting people together. I have a strong idea about Productivity and Communication. For this, I'm very positive that I could help leading and supporting the team, and make any projects into a success story.

## Personal Development
Positivity and Simplicity lead to true Happiness.

Like many other coders, I do have fun coding outside work and I have many personal projects at home. I like spending my spare time learning new programming languages and APIs that I might not use fluently at work and try to use them for making small games and software of my own interests. I also enjoy doing Web and Mobile development, sometimes getting involve in Weekend Game Jam using different frameworks and Game Engines.

It is very important to keep a good balance between mind and body. I'm a fluent Yoga practitioner, this is where I learn to be mindful and greatly improve my self-awareness. I like doing long distance hiking as a form of meditation. Going outdoors is also a good way to improve my diet and keeping fit. I like to observe and analyzing the movement of human body, so I'm all about body-weight training. I also enjoy playing various kinds of sports with my friends. Especially in our friendly football game, it is such a great fun socializing with each others.

Relaxation is an important key as well, I like reading books and listening to soft music at home. My favorite topic is usually around Productivity, Philosophy and Human Psychology. Using many techniques I learned from these books to help managing my time so I can stretch my limited capacity a little more, and be able to get more things done.
