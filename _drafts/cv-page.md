## Career aspect
My goal is about Learning and Exploring new methods in order to understand the full spectrum of Modern software development, especially in Video Games, Movies and Interactive software Industry.

I'm a well established Game Developer working in Game Industry for several years as a Graphic Programmer. I have a well-rounded knowledge about AAA Game Development in both Consoles and PC, DirectX and OpenGL.
I never thought myself as one of those smartest elites but I'm a natural learner and ready to push myself over the limits into learning new things. I always enjoy doing R&D, exploring new techniques in order to make the best out of modern hardwares and low-level APIs.

Apart from technical knowledge, I'm also very much interested in People and Project Management as well. I strongly believed that I have a good personality, I'm a team player with great skills for connecting people together. Moreover, I have a strong idea about Productivity and Communication. I'm very positive that I could help leading/supporting the team in order to finish any projects smoothly and successfully.

## Personal Development
Positivity and Simplicity lead to true Happiness.

Like many other coders, I do have fun coding outside work and I have many personal projects at home. I like spending my spare time learning new programming languages and APIs that I might not use fluently at work and try to use them for making small games and software of my own interests. I also do Web and Mobile development, or getting involve in Weekend Game Jam using different frameworks and Game Engines.

It is very important to keep a good balance between my mind and body. I'm a fluent Yoga practitioner, this is where I learn to be mindful and greatly improve self-awareness. I like doing long distance hiking as a form of meditation. Going outdoors is also a good way to improve my diet and keeping fit. I like to observe and analying the movement of human body, so I'm all about body-weight training and playing many types of sports, especially football.

Reading, I like reading books and listening to Smooth Jazz at home. My favorite topic is usually about Productivity, Philosophy and Human Psychology. Using many techniques I learned from these books to help managing my time so I have enough space to do as much as I can.
