## Things I like about reading
Collecting memorable quotes from books I've read.

### Holy Cow (David Duchovny)
> So I guess it's not so important that dreams come true, it's just important that you have a dream to begin with, to get you to take your first steps.

### Just like proper grown-ups (Christina Hopkinson)
> You've always been like a cat -- people are lucky to love you, not the other way round.
