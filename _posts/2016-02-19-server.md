I want to learn how to setup a Personal Server for my future projects

## Static Website
Why am I interested in Static Website Generator? 

### Nginx
Setup Nginx is pretty straight forward
It is possible to use one server and listening to different locations, like github 

### Git
This is my first time trying to setup Git repo on Linux box.
It is pretty good fun really.

### Jekyll
Jekyll is a popular static website generator

### Git and Jekyll
Without permission to use SSH at work, git-http-backend is a pretty neat way for me access my repo
Setting up the HTTP is slightly bit challenging, unlike SSH, since this doesn't work out of the box
I have spent a good amount of time trying to figure it out why my 'push' command doesn't work (yep! user permission problem)

Doing this I have a chance to learn
 - some NGINX script
 - some CGI script
 - a user permission problem (chmod chown to the rescue) 

### DDNS and Router setup
I'm using CloudFlare for a Free DNS Service
I use this following Python script to update my router IP to CloudFlare
<https://github.com/AmirAzodi/cloudflare_ddns>

setting up cron job
add a file called 'cf-ddns-cronjob' in /etc/cron.d folder
in the file add this single line to make the task run every hour
``` 0 * * * * _username /usr/bin/python ~/cf-ddns/cf-ddns.py >/dev/null 2>&1```

### NGINX Service at startup
This way I don't have to redo all the setup everytime the server is rebooted

1. Remove Apache2 Service (Apache is in Startup script by Default)
2. Add Nginx Service

``` 
update-rc.d -f apache2 remove
update-rc.d nginx defaults
```

### Useful Unix CMD
to see all the running services
``` sudo service --status-all```
To start a daemon at startup, defaults => default run levels 2,3,4 and 5
``` update-rc.d service_name defaults```
To remove
``` update-rc.d -f service_name remove```
