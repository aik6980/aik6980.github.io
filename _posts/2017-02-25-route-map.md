Where should I go walking this weekend?

## Amberley-Chichester via South downs
updated 26/03/17

An another beautiful walk along South downs way. A great discovery where a starting point , Amberley, is only 20 min away from Horsham by train.

This walk is perfect for a day walk if you like starting in early morning, a promise of full of fun hill climbing challenges. Scenic view ranged from hilltop, forest and even a beautiful private garden. 
Chichester is a great destination too, with a little adjustment, this walk could be slightly shorter so you can enjoy more time in the town

On this journey, I also found a nice blooming tree perfect for a [Marternitsa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martenitsa) I got from my friend :)

Welcome home, my lovely Spring <3

## Berwick-Hove

My first walk of 2017. This 36km walk from Berwick to Brighton is definitely a good start.
