"Does my happiness solely come from Yoga?" This is a very interesting question I got asked recently. It makes me think about myself, now and then. While my daily life hasn't changed much in the past five years, but somehow I feel like I've become a happier person than I have ever been. Why?

Let's start from the top, shall we?

As far as I remembered, I am always a happy, easy-going type of person. I was born as a healthy child, surrounded by well cared and loving family. We've never been rich but my life is definitely good all around. I was doing quite well at school, went to a well known University, graduated, eventually landed myself my dream job which I still enjoy doing it until these days. 

Hey, everything sounds so good! Don't you think?  

All of these surely make me happy, I cannot deny that. However, these kind of happiness is very depended so much on expectation from the society awarding me with their validation, gifts and social status, for example, because I work so hard and sometimes feeling stressful so I used money I earned to buy things, to party, going out drinking to comfort myself and feel better on some hard days. Many time I felt anxious beause I want to make sure people will like me. I worked day and night, keep improving myself so I can climb up the career ladder, aiming to be the best.

Nothing wrong with that, right? We're all work hard, play hard. Building social status and shooting for the top.

Well...those happiness depended heavily on validation from others which can turn into a pressure that could make you easily depressed. I should mentioned as well that while I worked long hours, I have only one life, I don't exercise and I eat badly. Additionally, happiness from buying shiny new things does not last very long either. Actually it faded out very quickly and it can turn to a worrying when I have to find space to keep all of those items.

I think I will write about how I break apart from the world of materialism and become a keen minimalist later.
Anyway, I made a break-thru eventually. If you asked I've never thought at this point in life, my journey have just begun...

About five years ago, my life style has turned 180. From a person who spent most of the time inside, I've adopted a very active way of living, and quickly become quite a energetic person.

I went out running, losing half of my body weight, I have become pretty fit I can play better at any sports than I've ever done before in my life. 

I'm happy seeing myself improving physically. However, while I'm tougher outside, inside I still feel I'm under a lot of emotions and I don't know how to control them. I can achieve more with my body, but I also accidentally build a small unshakable ego, and I put an expectation on others without realizing.

Since the very beginning, I always feel more comfortable around machines, and I dont really like being around people so much. This amplified my belief, making me feel even more disgust of our modern society.   

After that, I started going out hiking long distance. I always love mountain, and now I'm also  ready physically therefore I tried to go as far as possible from our chaotic society. More time I spend time alone with natures I've experienced solitude, I experienced freedom. Probably for the first time ever in my life I found one practical way to reconnect me back to myself, to the back of my mind. 

When I reached the top of the hill, out of no where. The relaxing atmosphere is indescribable, plenty of fresh air, smell of grass and the quietness. I can spread my personal space as far as I want it to be without any worries. For me, this is definitely a true happiness right there. 

The only problem is when I got back home,   
I want more...   

Pretty much at this point I have found out a lot about myself, and this kind of happiness is well worth it, at the same time it's very hard to earn. I have to plan, go out running, walking for several hours, sometimes several days. In order to get my brain to release those mixture of happy doses. Those sort of runner high chemical is damn great, but unfortunately our brain can be so forgetful. And the only way to have it more is to try even harder.

I've become an addict. I went out and getting into more intensively. I broke my body physically, so often, so many times, just for have a bit more of these doses of happiness.

One time I hurt myself so bad, and has to be bedridden for several days. This is when the fuun stopped and I don't want to injure myself that bad anymore.

My sister then introduced me to something sounds pretty hippy called Yoga. Truly say, it probably is the greatest gift I've ever received in my entire life.

And here is my story how I come back to love humans again.

Technically, Yoga is one of the oldest system of personal development in the world. This system of balancing the body, mind and spirit. Developed by people who understood man's essential nature and realized the way to utilise our inner resources to live in harmony with himself and the environment.

What's amazing about Yoga is that it will teach you more about yourself and how to love and be happy with it. It helped me reconnect with my body in a mindful way while keeping the good feeling no different from going out torturing myself. Yoga has taught me to accept my limitation, and help me being mindful about others. It helped me regain the sight to appreciate the beauty of uniqueness in every human being, and we are capable of being great in doing different things.  

By practicing Yoga it definitely will create happiness for you. However, it probably won't reward you with a huge chunk of happiness like buying a new car, or a rush to your brain like running a marathon.

I think practicing Yoga alone won't create the happiness I have today either. However, by reconnecting back to myself, mindfully, it helped me gain a realization that I'm able to tap into a pool of happiness that stored in the back of my brain. This is like unlocking a chest which is full of treasure that I've been collecting for all my life.

Thinking about it, those happiness has already been there with me, all this time. but our forgetful brain cannot see it as a whole but a scattered pieces mixing with pile of many other emotions I have experienced throughout my life. 

Not only that, Yoga will do you an even greater favor by helping your brain realized those small pieces of happiness are actually everywhere your normal daily life!

The happiness from looking at the Sun, 
from the birds sing,
from truthfully smiling at each others,

Nowadays, I feel like I can be honest to myself and speak it out loud, while being useful to others without worrying about any validation.

I am also grateful to have others helping me living my life. 

Yoga also helps opening up the door to other sources of body and mind practice. In my case, it has brought me Pilates, Zen Meditation and etc.

Practicing meditation can give your a super power.

Being mindful is like having a super power to travel to your happy place whenever you want. It helps you see yourself form the third person perspective. It helps you to stand still among the chaos of our modern society.

Non TD;LR version

In my opinion, Yoga itself isn't my main source of happiness, actually if you practice Yoga like Sports while ignoring practicing Mindfulness. Yoga will harm you with injuries, and even causes depression. However, doing it correctly, I've seen myself has been developed into a better person as it helped me to be able to find balance in my life. I have a healthier mind and body, which leaded to my new foundation of happiness, which is created from within myself. 

Outside in, It also helped me to realize and appreciate those little happiness that happening all around me. 

Yoga's taught me to be honest to myself, to be more open minded. It's reconnected my body with the nature I love, with our Mother Earth. Not only that, it's also reconnected my mind back to our society, to other human being. It helped me see through Chaos, observing the Beauty of everything, while kept being emotionally Stable. 

Yoga also showed me the way to other mindfulness practices. Through this, I've become a keen practitioner of different several kinds of Meditation. It took me away from the need of Materialism, and helped me adopting more Minimalism life style. 

I can feel that I've become more self-sustain. I've become more capable to take care of my mind and body. I've become more confident and ready to carry myself through any chaos in life. I'm ready to contribute back and become more useful to our Community. 

The best thing is that, nowadays I've become myself's Best Friend.

And That's what make me a happy person, like I've never been before.
