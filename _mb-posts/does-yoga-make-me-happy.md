"Does my happiness mainly come from practicing Yoga?" This is a very interesting question I got asked recently, and it makes me rethink about myself, how I live my whole life and what is it that make me happy at the first place. While my life mainly hasn't changed much in the past five years, but somehow I strongly believe that I've become a happier person than I have ever been.

Let's start from the top, shall we?

As far as I remembered, I am always a happy, easy-going type of person generally. I was born as a happy child, surrounded by well cared and loving family. We've never been rich but my life is definitely good in general. I went to a well known University, graduated, working my drem job and I still enjoy doing it until these days. 

Hey, everything sounds so good Aik! Look like a very successful happy life?  

Surely it is. I have achieve a well big chunk of happiness, and I'm very grateful. I got well accepted by the society. I lived my life making sure people will love me, and I keep improving myself so I can be useful.

That sounds great, right? Building your social status while being useful.

But...really, sometimes I don't even know who is really me? I mean, I knew what I want, and what I'm doing. I can use my saving to buy shiny items that make me happy. However, most of time I do feel like I need a 'validation'. I also do feel pressure from work, pressure trying to be loved, pressure trying to be a person that is 'worthwhile'.

At this point in time, my happiness is very short-live. It seems to happen very fast and don't last very long. They are also seems to be very easy to forget, like.. in just a few minutes, and I have to go back and working hard on finding it again.  

Around five years ago, my life style has changed drastically. From a person who spent most of the time working inside, I've adopted a very active life style. I went out running, losing half of my body weight, I have become pretty fit I can play better at any sports than I've ever done before. 

But... I still feel I'm under a lot of emotions sometimes. I still have many expectation which I cannot shake them off. If I can do these things, I should be happy, right? 

After that, I started going out walking. I often do my walk along, spend time with myself as far as possible from other human beings. Walking away from our chaotic society made me feel so good. More time I spend time alone with natures I've experienced solitude, I experienced freedom. Probably for the first time ever in my life I found one practical way to reconnect me back to myself, to the back of my mind. 

When I reached the top of the hill, out of nowhere. The relaxing atmosphere is indescribable, plenty of fresh air, smell of grass and the quietness. There is a large stream of happiness flowing into me and I have to admit, I totally love it.  

Now I found my happiness, I found my happy place. I want more...   

However, this type of happiness is very hard to earn. I have to plan, go out running, walking for several hours, sometimes several days. In order to get my brain to release those mixture of happy doses. Those sort of runner high chemical is damn great, but unfortunately our brain can be so forgetful. And the only way to have it more is to try even harder.

So intense, I broke my body physically so many times just for have a bit more of these doses of happiness.

I'm an addict...

My sister introduced me to Yoga while I was recovering from one of my injury. I was skeptical at first, now I have to admit it probably the greatest gift I've ever received in my life.

Now Yoga? Ok. I have heard about it. But, what is it really? Does it make your happy?

Yoga is a training method that focused on balancing several aspects of your life. As a practictioner, 

What's good about Yoga is that it will help you to learn more about yourself. Every single human body is different, and Yoga has taught me to accept my limitation, to accept others, to stop comparing, and learn to be aware about your body.

In Yoga, there is a form of Meditation called Yama.

I think practicing Yoga alone won't create the happiness I have today. Thinking about it, those happiness has already been there, all this time. but my forgetful brain cannot see it as a whole but a scattered pieces mixing with pile of many other emotions I have experienced throughout my life.

Yoga itself probably won't give you a huge chunk of happiness, or a rush to your brain like running, but it will help your brain realized those happiness does exist, inside you.

Being mindful is like having a super power to travel to your happy place whenever you want. It helps you see yourself form the third person perspective. It helps you to stand still among the chaos of our modern society. 

And I'm very happy to tell you that it can get even better.
