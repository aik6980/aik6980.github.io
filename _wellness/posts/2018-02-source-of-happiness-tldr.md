This is a TL;DR version of my previous post on "Is Yoga the sole source of my happiness?"
[wellness/posts/2018-02-source-of-happiness](/wellness/posts/2018-02-source-of-happiness)

I found this is a very interesting question I got asked recently (Enough that I really want to share it with everyone). What is it exactly that make me happy these days, are they different from what I thought back in my younger years? While my daily life hasn't changed much in the past five years, but somehow I feel like I've become a happier person than I've ever been.

##### Let's start from the very beginning, shall we?
---
As far as I remembered, I am always a happy, easy-going type of person. I was born as a healthy child, surrounded by well cared and loving family. My family is not rich but we definitely have enough of everything. I was doing quite well at school, went to a well known University, graduated, eventually landed myself my dream job which I still enjoy doing it until these days. 

---
##### Hey, everything sounds so good! Don't you think?
---
All of these surely make me happy, many huge chunk of happiness really, I cannot deny that. However, these kind of happiness sometimes come with such pressure as these are very much depended on expectation from the society awarding me with their validation, gifts and social status, for example, because I work so hard and sometimes feeling stressful so I used money I earned to buy things, to party, going out drinking to comfort myself and feel better on some hard days. Many time I felt anxious beause I want to make sure people will like me. I worked day and night, keep improving myself so I can climb up the career ladder, aiming to be the best.

##### Nothing wrong with that, right? We're all work hard, play hard. Building social status and shooting for the top.
---
Well...because those happiness depended heavily on validation from others which can turn into a pressure that could make you easily depressed. I should mentioned as well that while I worked long hours, my life see mostly at a single dimension, I don't exercise, I eat badly. While I still smile, my health degraded. Additionally, happiness from spending money buying shiny new things does not last very long either. Actually it faded out very quickly and it can turn to a worrying when I have to find space to keep all of those items. Materialism is a very scary trap, honestly.

Think I will write about how I break apart from the world of materialism and become a keen minimalist later.

Anyway, I made a break-thru eventually. If you asked I've never thought at this point in life, my new interesting journey have just begun...

##### About five years ago, my life style has turned upside down. For the better!
---
From a person who spent most of the time inside a room, in front of a computer. Now I've adopted a very active way of living, and quickly become quite a energetic person.

I found myself went out running, losing half of my body weight, I have become pretty fit I can play better at any sports than I've ever done before in my life. 

I'm happy seeing myself improving physically. However, while I'm tougher outside, inside I still feel I'm under a lot of emotions and I don't know how to control them. I can achieve more with my body, but I also accidentally build a small unshakable ego, and I put an expectation on others without realizing.

Since the very beginning, I always feel more comfortable around machines, and I dont really like being around people so much. This amplified my belief, making me feel even more disgust of our modern society.   

After that, I started going out hiking long distance. I always love mountain, and now I'm also  ready physically therefore I tried to go as far as possible from our chaotic society. More time I spend time alone with natures I've experienced solitude, I experienced freedom. Probably for the first time ever in my life I found one practical way to reconnect me back to myself, to the back of my mind. 

When I reached the top of the hill, out of no where. The relaxing atmosphere is indescribable, plenty of fresh air, smell of grass and the quietness. I can spread my personal space as far as I want it to be without any worries. For me, this is definitely a true happiness right there. 

The only problem is when I got back home. I don't have quiet mind. 
I want more...  

Pretty much at this point I have found out a lot about myself, about the feeling that I like, and this kind of happiness is well worth it, but at the same time it's very hard to earn. I have to plan, go out running, walking for several hours, sometimes several days. In order to get my brain to release those mixture of happy doses. Those sort of runner high chemical is damn great, but unfortunately our brain can be so forgetful. And the only way to have it more is to try even harder.

I've become an addict. I went out and getting into more intensively. The price I've paid is immensive too as I broke my body physically very so often, so many times. I have injured my back, my knees, my feet, my neck etc. I went in and out Physiotherapy. I want to hit the limit, just for have a bit more of these doses of happiness.

One day... I hurted myself so bad, too bad I cannot even move, and I'd to be bedridden for several days and I'm scared. This is when the fun stopped, and I really, have to stop.
I don't want to injure myself anymore.

During recovery time, my sister then introduced me to something sounds pretty hippy called Yoga. Truly say, I was skepitical at first, but at the end, This probably is the greatest gift I've ever obtained in my entire life.

##### And here is the part of my story how I brought myself from the extreme back into balance
---
Technically, Yoga is one of the oldest system of personal development in the world. This system of balancing the body, mind and spirit. Developed by people who understood man's essential nature and realized the way to utilise our inner resources to live in harmony with himself and the environment.

What's amazing about Yoga is that it will teach you about yourself and how to love and be happy with it. It helped me reconnect with my body in a mindful way while keeping that great feeling of achievement, no different from going out torturing myself like I did before. Yoga has taught me to accept my limitation, and help me being mindful about others. It helped me regain the sight to appreciate the beauty of uniqueness in every human being as well. I now can see the beauty of people, as we are capable of being great in doing different things.  

By practicing Yoga it definitely will bring happiness. However, it probably won't reward you with a huge chunk of happiness like buying a new car, or a rush to your brain like running a marathon.

In my opinion, Yoga itself isn't my main source of happiness either, actually if you practice Yoga like Sports while ignoring practicing Mindfulness. Yoga will harm you badly with injuries, and even causes depression. However, doing it correctly, I've seen myself has been developed into a better person as it helped me to be able to find balance in my life. I have a healthier mind and body, which leaded to my new foundation of happiness, which is created from within myself.

Now, I've gained a realization that I'm able to tap into a pool of happiness that stored in the back of my brain. 
This is like unlocking into my saving account that I've been collecting for all my life, without ever realizing its existence.

Thinking about it again, those happiness has already been there with me, all the time. Unfortunately, my forgetful brain cannot see it as a whole but most of the time, this looks like a mixing piles of many emotions I have experienced altogether instead. Now, I've learnt to pick out the positivity and be able to negotiate, and handle, or something just simply neglect, those negativity. 

Outside in, It also helped me to realize and appreciate those little happiness that happening all around me. Now, I can see, I can sense those little happiness from all surrounding. I've learnt to love and enjoy life, I'm grateful for the time, for the day, for the weather. I'm grateful for my work, for food, for warm cloths, and I'm grateful that I have everyone and everything, that helping me living my life. 

Yoga's taught me to be honest to myself, to be more open minded. It's reconnected my body with the nature I love, with our Mother Earth. Not only that, it's also reconnected my mind back to our society, to other human being. It helped me see through Chaos, observing the Beauty of everything, while kept being emotionally Stable. Now, I'm free from any unnecessary validation I used to hung up to.

Yoga's also showed me and opened the way to other mindfulness practices. Through this, I've become a keen practitioner of different several kinds of Meditation. 
Now, this helped taking me away from the need of Materialism, and helped me adopting more Minimalistic life style. 

I can feel that I've become more self-sustain. I've become more capable to take care of my mind and body. I've become more confident and ready to carry myself through any chaos in life that might happen (and it'll pass). Moreover, I'm more than ready to contribute back and become more useful to our community, our beautiful and chaotic society. 

And one last thing worth mentioning, and this is the best. Now, I knew that I'd never feel alone again, because, nowadays I've become my Best Friend, of myself.

And all of these together is what make me a happy person, like I've never been before.
