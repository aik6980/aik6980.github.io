Most people equate physical strength with upper body strength, but Yoga teaches your entire body to be strong from inside out. Each part is integrated with the larger whole while retaining individual responsibility for lifting, stretching, and strengthening itself. When they try to lift their hip off the ground, many students feel as though their arms are too short, their upper body is too weak, or their bums are too large. The answer to this doubt is the magical mystery of the **Bandhas**, which literally means 'locks'. These mysterious locks are internal and can be cultivated through the careful use of the pelvic muscles. We are going to discuss the movements that help you feel the bandhas, but remember that these are energetic experiences that are closer to emptiness than to any muscular movement.
When you find out how strong you can be at the center of your body, you will feel light and liberated. The bandhas are invaluable in the sacred effort to bring energy up the spine, along the center column of the body, and through the crown of the head.

##Mula Bandhas - Root Lock
Sit in a comfortable, cross-legged position on the floor with your spine in a neutral, erect position. Feel both of your sit bones and the space between them. Now squeeze your sit bones together without changing the position of your pelvis and without squeezing your gluteal muscles.
Next, feel your tailbone and public bone. Draw them closer together so that all four points of your pelvis move toward each other. Increase the level of activation so that your sit bones, tailbone, and public bone draw in as much as possible. This consciously activates the interior space of your of your pelvis (pic) 

Be careful not to change the position of your pelvis or activate your thighs and gluteal muscles.

Next, contract your anus and squeeze your urethra as though your are stopping yourself from urinating. Add that to the activations you are already doing. Contract your perineum (pelvic floor) by lifting it into your pelvis. If you are a woman, squeeze your cervix and the walls of your vagina; if you are a man, lift your testicles. Connect your anus, urethra, perineum, and genitals in one big contraction.

Finally, draw this contraction into your body along your spine and try to move it up and in. Feel the movement into the interior spaceof the pelvis. Over time you will be able to activate this whole network of movements in one fluid contraction.

##Uddiyana Bandhas - Upward Flying Lock
Applying what you know now about mula bandhas, relax your stomach and let go of any overexertion in your abdominal muscles. Draw your belly, from the navel to the public bone, back and into your body as though your are trying to suck in your stomach to fit into a tight pair of jeans. Let this action be released but not soft, more like an elongation than a static contraction. Try thinking about it as a reverse contraction or a sucking in of the abdominal muscles. if the abdominal wall hardens, let go and start again.

Combine the mula bandhas action with this reverse contraction, and let all the muscles come together to provide support for your pelvis and lift from within. Breathe into your lungs - into the front, back, and sides of body - while allowing the energy of the breath to travel up and down your spine. 

Avoid breathing into your belly; in some challenging Asanas, this can predispose you for injury.

##Application
The pelvic floor and the accompanying muscles are like any other part of the body. The more you use them, the stronger they get on a physical and energetic level. YOu can expect your awareness and control of this area to increase as you practice more.

It might be useful to think of mula bandha and uddiyana bandha coming together to create an energetic sensation of emptiness or even brilliant light located at your center of gravity. The spiritual power center inside the pelvis is referred to by some classical Hatha Yoga texts as teh Kanda center. 

##Foundation - Plank Position
the upper body is crucial to teh development of strength but works most efficiently when it is integrated into the whole. Rather than thinking about arm strength, it is better to develop a solid structural foundation.

Begin on your hands and knees. Align your shoulders over the palms of your hands and your hips over your knees. Relax your spine. Engage your fingertips, plants your knuckles (but not your fingers or palms), and thrust the heel of your hand into the floor. Allow the 'smiles' of your elbows to point approximately forty-five degrees forward and rotate your shoulders down your back to open them. Broaden your collarbones and guide your shoulder blades down your back and away from each other. Activate your deltoids, latissimus dorsi, and serratus anterior muscles (pic). Lift the center of your sternum to fill out the space between your shoulders. Draw your ribs in, apply mula bandha, and uddiyana bandha, and tuck your tailbone under. Finally, engage your legs and straighten your knees while keeping your chest forward over your hands (pic - plank).

This is the foundation position from which all strength-based poses can be performed. If you find it challenging, hold this position as long as possible once a day and you will grow stronger.
